### Hi there, I'm Diogo Soares 👋

I'm currently studying computer science at Maringá State University (Universidade Estadual de Maringá UEM). 

I started exploring development out of curiosity, and I’ve been loving the journey so far. I have already worked with the following techs:
- Spring Boot
- Nest js
- React js
- Node js

And nowadays I'm still interested in web development with:
- React js
- Node js
- Nest js
- Next js

I hope you enjoyed my profile and please don't be shy to reach out to me anytime. I'll leave here my personal information: 
- Email: diogofelipe.dev@gmail.com
