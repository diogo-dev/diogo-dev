### Hi there, I'm Diogo Soares ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying computer science at MaringÃ¡ State University (Universidade Estadual de MaringÃ¡ UEM). 

I'm a curious person and that is the main reason I got started in learning about development. I have already worked with:
- Java
- Android Studio
- Basic Front-End

Nowadays I'm interested in:
- JavaScript and TypeScript
